* For every read of a piece of nonfiction, if you get 3 Big Ideas out of it, that you can relate to your friends, it's a success. in fact, should probably update website to reflect this =D
* Pottery as meditation.
* Just Don't Die as a concept seems important across fields --evolution, investing (it seems to be a common theme in all the books Charlie Munger recommends), real-estate (location location location), etc.
* What is special about Toronto.
* You can just make stuff: my wife and I made rings for each other, designed based on what we think the other would enjoy. My wife's spirit animal is a turtle, so the pattern on her ring is tortoise-shell. I like the ocean and the mountains, so my ring has a wave and mountain ridge pattern. Making each other rings was fun, and significantly more meaningful than just buying jewelry at a store. And it seems plain that this principle can be extended further: if you want something made, you can most likely just make it.
* List of crafts to do on dates, ranked.
* email as an interface to back-office work.
* if an LLM can already do it perfectly, is it worth doing? related to the Karpathy post about him trying to build a training repo from scratch, and trying to get Claude to help build, and Claude just continuously trying to import pytorch FSDP.
* Things that compound (skills, relationships, knowledge, company abilities, trees).
* Micro-PMF --inspired by micro-morts and micro-marriages.
* I wonder what it is about people that makes us love seeing people who have truly mastered a discipline. It's such a treat to watch Federer or Magnus or Mbappe play, or watch Dwarkesh or Dylan or Tyler talk.
* Are places with more ideal climes better suited to deep thinking than places where you need to always think about the weather? E.g. would SF produce as many companies if it were moved degrees north to Vanderhoof, BC?
* Technology allows for both easier creation, and easier consumption. It seems right now like consuming is winning: feeds are populated systems that learn to maximise time spent on them, whereas if you're someone trying to get ranked high on the feed, you still need to do the work with your own brain of figuring out what is likely to do well or not...
* Chess set where if you move your queen you get an electric shock, if you move your rook you get a smaller electric shock etc, and if you move your pawns you don't get an electric shock.
* Chess set where all the pieces are made of pure tungsten. Excellent for blitz.
* Alcohol chess set where every piece is a glass and if you take that piece you drink whatever is in that glass. The great equaliser.
* You've heard of desks, you've heard of standing desks, you've never heard of squatting desks. Why?
