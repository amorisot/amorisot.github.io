* For every read of a piece of nonfiction, if you get 3 Big Ideas out of it, that you can relate to your friends, it's a success. in fact, should probably update website to reflect this :)
* Pottery as meditation
* Just Don't Die as a concept seems important across fields --evolution, investing (it seems to be a common theme in all the books Charlie Munger recommends), real-estate (location location location), etc.

* You can just make stuff: my wife and I made rings for each other, designed based on what we think the other would enjoy. My wife's spirit animal is a turtle, so the pattern on her ring is tortoise-shell. I like the ocean and the mountains, so my ring has a wave and mountain ridge pattern. Making each other rings was fun, and significantly more meaningful than just buying jewelry at a store. And it seems plain that this principle can be extended further: if you want something made, you can most likely just make it.
