      <h3>micro-pmf</h3>
      <p>The existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort">micromorts</a> and <a href="https://colah.github.io/personal/micromarriages/">micromarriages</a> implies the existence of micro-pmf's, associated with actions you take to increase the probability that your startup builds something that reaches product-market fit.</p>
      <p>An incomplete (and largely facetious) list:</p>
      <p>- Thinking about your product in the shower = 1 micro-pmf
- Talking to a customer = 2 micro-pmfs
- Listening to a customer = 10 micro-pmfs
- Hiring an engineer = 10 micro-pmfs
- Hiring a 10x engineer = 100 micro-pmfs
- Hiring a 100x engineer = 1 milli-pmf
- Closing a deal = 100 micro-pmfs
- Going to a conference to network = -10 micro-pmfs
- Having heated debates with your cofounders = 25 micro-pmfs</p>
      <p>I'll update these, probably with more earnesty, as my co-proprietorship of my small business evolves.</p>
