      <p>Ideas I'm mulling over, that may one day grow into full posts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For every read of a piece of nonfiction, if you get 3 Big Ideas out of it, that you can relate to your friends, it's a success. in fact, should probably update website to reflect this :)</li>
        <li>Pottery as meditation</li>
        <li>Just Don't Die as a concept seems important across fields --evolution, investing (it seems to be a common theme in all the books Charlie Munger recommends), real-estate (location location location), etc.</li>
        <li>What is special about Toronto</li>
        <li>You can just make stuff: my wife and I made rings for each other, designed based on what we think the other would enjoy. My wife's spirit animal is a turtle, so the pattern on her ring is tortoise-shell. I like the ocean and the mountains, so my ring has a wave and mountain ridge pattern. Making each other rings was fun, and significantly more meaningful than just buying jewelry at a store. And it seems plain that this principle can be extended further: if you want something made, you can most likely just make it</li>
        <li>List of crafts to do on dates, ranked</li>
        <li>email as an interface to back-office work</li>
        <li>if an LLM can already do it perfectly, is it worth doing? related to the Karpathy post about him trying to build a training repo from scratch, and trying to get Claude to help build, and Claude just continuously trying to import pytorch FSDP.</li>
        <li>Things that compound (skills, relationships, knowledge, company abilities, trees)</li>
        <li>Micro-PMF --inspired by micro-morts and micro-marriages</li>
        <li>Models don't seem capable of vibe coding compelling motherboard SVGs</li>
      </ul>
